# Warsim_animal_faces

So here it is, the cool thing.

The contents of this repository are (as of 2017-08-01):
- Faces for 17+1 different species of animals to be used for the game Warsim.
- A list over which animals now have faces, and which remain.

NOTE: These are not free to use, only Huw2k8, the creator of Warsim, the game for which these faces were made, 
      and I, the original creator of these faces, may use them freely, with the notion that proper crediting must be in place.
