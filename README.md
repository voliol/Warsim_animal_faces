# Warsim_animal_faces

So here it is, the cool thing.

The contents of this repository are (as of 2018-08-19):
- Faces for 23 different species of animals to be used for the game Warsim.
- A list over which animals now have faces, and which remain.
- A plan that more, if not all, faces will be completed.

Update #0(2017-08-01):
- First version, incuding 17+1 faces.  

Update #1(2017-10-20):
- Added horse, donkey and unicorn faces, and removed the "extra" status from the pig one, bringing the total face count up to 21 from previously 17+1.
- Updated the list accordingly.

Update #2(2018-08-19):
- Added capybary, camel and orangutan faces, plus one "extra" in form of a sawfish, bringing the total face count up to 24+1 from previously 21.
- Updated the list accordingly.

NOTE: These are not free to use, only Huw2k8, the creator of Warsim, the game for which these faces were made, 
      and I, the original creator of these faces, may use them freely, with the notion that proper crediting must be in place.
