# Warsim_animal_faces

So here it is, the cool thing.

The contents of this repository are (as of 2018-08-31):
- Faces for 36+1 different species of animals to be used for the game Warsim.
- A list over which animals now have faces, and which remain.
- A plan that more, if not all, faces will be completed.

Update #0(2017-08-01):
- First version, incuding 17+1 faces.  

Update #1(2017-10-20):
- Added horse, donkey and unicorn faces, and removed the "extra" status from the pig one, bringing the total face count up to 21 from previously 17+1.
- Updated the list accordingly.

Update #2(2018-08-19):
- Added capybary, camel and orangutan faces, plus one "extra" in form of a sawfish, bringing the total face count up to 24+1 from previously 21.

Update #3(2018-08-29):
- Added sheep face, plus two "extra" in form of rabbit, hare, bringing the total face count up to 25+3 from previously 24+1.

Update #4(2018-08-31):
- Recalculated the entire list, updating the "to-do" part and recounting the numbers. 
- Added eel, cow, bull/ox, and yak faces, as well as big and small faces for dragon and wyrm, bringing the total (now properly re-counted) species-with-face count up to 36+1.

NOTE: These are not free to use, only Huw2k8, the creator of Warsim, the game for which these faces were made, 
      and I, the original creator of these faces, may use them freely, with the notion that proper crediting must be in place.
      An "extra" face is a face belonging to an animal not currently in the game, or is in the game but I've missed it.
